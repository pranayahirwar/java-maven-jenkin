# Jenkin CI/CD

In this project, I used Jenkins as a continuous integration and deployment tool. I set up Jenkins on a docker and configured it to run builds automatically whenever new code was pushed to a repository.

I created a pipeline in Jenkins that would pull the code from the repository, run tests to ensure the code was working properly, and then deploy the code to a staging or production environment.

Using Jenkins allowed me to automate the development and deployment process, which saved me time and ensured that new code was delivered to users quickly and reliably.
